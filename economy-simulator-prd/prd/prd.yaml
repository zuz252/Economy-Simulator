project:
  name: "Economy Simulator"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "AI-Powered Bank Analysis and Simulation: A dynamic tool for bank leadership and finance students to analyze a bank's condition, performance, and risk profile. The platform enables both historical analysis and forward-looking simulation of strategic decisions under various macroeconomic scenarios, leveraging Generative AI for quantitative and qualitative insights."
  repository: "https://github.com/zuz252/Economy-Simulator"

Overview:
objective: >
  The primary goal of this application is to create a multi-user simulation that demonstrates how monetary and fiscal policy impact the decisions of banks, businesses, and consumers. The simulation is designed to show the interconnectedness of these economic players and how their individual actions affect the broader economic system. A particular focus is placed on the banking sector, examining how external factors influence banks and how their decisions, in turn, impact the economy.

key_players_and_roles:
  - name: "The Federal Reserve (The Fed)"
    description: "Acts as a single entity, but its decisions can be made by up to 12 players representing the voting members of the FOMC."
  - name: "Government"
    description: "Can be represented by both a domestic and a foreign government. A single player or a group of players can act as the government."
  - name: "Banks"
    description: "The simulation can support an unlimited number of banks, with players making decisions for each."
  - name: "Businesses"
    description: "The simulation can include many businesses, with decision-making split among players."
  - name: "Consumers"
    description: "The model will have a set number of consumers, with players controlling their decisions."
  - name: "Trade Partners"
    description: "Other countries can participate, making their own economic decisions."

player_levers_and_actions:
  The_Fed:
    - "Set the Fed funds rate through open market operations to influence interest rates and the money supply."
  Banks:
    - "Determine deposit and loan rates."
    - "Manage deposit beta."
    - "Define loan portfolio mix and loan policy."
  Consumers:
    - "Make choices about consumption, savings, and taking out loans."
  Businesses:
    - "Make employment and investment decisions."
  Government:
    - "Set fiscal policy, including stimulus, tax revenue, and expenditures."
    - "Establish trade policies and tariffs."

metrics_for_success:
  Countries: "Measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment."
  The_Fed: "Judged on its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment."
  Consumers: "Aim to maximize their savings and overall utility."
  Businesses: "Focus on maximizing shareholder value, measured by net income or earnings per share."

ai_and_automation:
  autonomous_agents: >
    AI agents can play any role if there are not enough human players. The simulation will include AI agents for a macroeconomist, lender, consumer, business CEO, Fed chairman, and a historian.
  scenario_generation: >
    An AI agent will be responsible for creating macroeconomic scenarios that react to the simulation's progression.
  narrative_based_adjustments: >
    An AI agent will be able to take a written narrative and adjust the simulation's parameters accordingly.
  post_round_analysis: >
    The AI will provide an explanation of each round from every player's perspective, including the pros and cons of their decisions.
  post_simulation_debrief: >
    An AI committee will engage in a post-simulation conversation with players to analyze how the game was played.

user_interface_and_features:
  - "Player-Specific UIs: Each player type (Fed, country, consumer, business) will have a unique user interface."
  - "Simulation Dashboard: A graphical dashboard will display key statistics across all economic sectors and summarize the decisions made in each round. This will also be available as presentation notes."
  - "Round Replay: Players will have the ability to replay any round."
  - "Configurable Settings: The simulation will allow for setting the number of rounds, and the starting positions for banks, businesses, and consumers can be configured. Historical starting positions can also be simulated."
  - "Player Tips: Tips will be provided to players in each round as needed."
